# FabricOptimize
An optimization modpack (Java Edition only) for those using the ofiicial Minecraft launcher for Windows that uses the Fabric Loader and some great optimization mods to make your game run smoother.
## Credits
I am extremely grateful to the following people and organizations that contributed to the making of this modpack:
### Madis0
Huge thanks to [Madis0](https://github.com/Madis0) for making the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized) which helped me in the following ways:
1. It actually made minecraft playable at decent settings (even with OptiFine, I couldn't run Minecraft at 2 chunks with the lowest settings possible without getting extreme lag spikes, FPS drops to 0 and crashes)
2. It introduced me to the world of Fabric modding, and thus resulted in me finding a lot of useful client-side mods that enhanced my gameplay experience, as well the creation of this modpack.
### The Fabric Dev Team
1. For creating and maintaining [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/)
2. For helping me out with the part of the scripts that install Fabric and tolerating my stupid questions on that subject.
### The developers of the mods used in the modpack
1. For creating and maintaining the mods that help me and so many others out. [List of mods included in the modpack](https://example.com/)
(If you want your mod removed from the modpack, please let me know)
## Prerequisites
1. Open Powershell as Administrator, and run `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`. This lets you run scripts downloaded online.
